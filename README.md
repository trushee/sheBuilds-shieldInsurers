# Shield Insurers - Blockchain based Health Insurance
Our project has the potential to oust the obsolete health insurance websites and apps due to the following reasons :

It is a faster method as it works on the basis of an encoded set of rules known as smart contracts .

It automatically processes the payment after approval and thus saves a lot of time.

The method is transparent as there is only a single version of truth which is accessible to all the stakeholders. All the parties have access to the same information.

Less prone to hacks and thefts due to transperancy.

The transactions are encrypted which makes it a lot more safe and secure .There's no need to worry about information being tampered with for personal gain because there's no third party engaged and encrypted transaction logs are exchanged among participants.
Easy method to generate claims based on smart contract and easy access and approval methods.

Automate the execution of agreements so that all participants can ascertain the outcome as soon as possible without the involvement of an intermediary or time delay.
